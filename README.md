This was one of my very first projects (2021). It's a complete project, but I abandoned it due to my lack of experience and poorly written code. It is not good and contains lots of bugs and bad practices, I share it here only for the proving previous experience not because its good or helpful. 

You'll see some of the folders are missing its because they are mostly third partly libraries.
